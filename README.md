## Trivia

- The f90 "Sullyplus" quine purpose was only to get "Fortran" displayed on my github page
- The COBOL version also features a LIDL Makefile
- Dr Quine's true name isn't Harley Quine
- I failed my career as an humorist
- Also, pushing this project on your vogsphere will grant you a -42 by me in person :)
